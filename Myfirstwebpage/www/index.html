        <h1>&quot;If&quot;, by Rudyard Kipling</h1>
        <blockquote>
            <p> If you can keep your head when all about you<br>
                Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,<br>
                If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,<br>
                But make allowance for their doubting too;<br>
                If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,<br>
                Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,<br>
                Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,<br>
                And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:<br></p>
            <p> If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;<br>
                If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;<br>
                If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster<br>
                And treat those two impostors just the same;<br>
                If you can bear to hear the truth you've spoken<br>
                Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,<br>
                Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,<br>
                And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:<br></p>
            <p> If you can make one heap of all your winnings<br>
                And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,<br>
                And lose, and start again at your beginnings<br>
                And never breathe a word about your loss;<br>
                If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew<br>
                To serve your turn long after they are gone,<br>
                And so hold on when there is nothing in you<br>
                Except the Will which says to them: &quot;Hold on!&quot;<br></p>
            <p> If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,<br>
                Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,<br>
                If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,<br>
                If all men count with you, but none too much;<br>
                If you can fill the unforgiving minute<br>
                With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,<br>
                Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,<br>
                And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son.<br></p>
